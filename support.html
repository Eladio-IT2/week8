            <h4>Flowchart Description</h4>
            <p>When a device malfunctions, an initial judgement is first required to determine the nature and likely cause of the fault. Depending on the outcome of the judgement, the fault can be classified as a software problem or a hardware problem. For software problems, you can try to solve the problem by restarting the device, if it is not effective, you may need to consider restoring the factory settings or updating the system. If the problem still exists, it is recommended to contact professional service personnel for further troubleshooting and repair. For hardware issues, you first need to check the network settings or change the network environment to solve possible network-related problems. If the problem is not related to the network, you need to check the hardware components of the device, such as the screen, battery, camera, etc., and replace the hardware once it is found to be damaged. If the problem remains unresolved, it is recommended to contact the network operator for network-related assistance or consider anti-virus treatment in specific scenarios. During the troubleshooting process, if the problem is successfully resolved, the user can use the phone normally; if the problem is still unresolved, it is recommended to contact the mobile phone after-sales service or a professional repair shop for in-depth testing and repair.</p>
